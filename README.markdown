# Autocorrect

It looks like you mis-spelled that method name. Would you like some help?

If you want some help in correcting your method name typos when developing a
chunk of Ruby code, stick this gem in your project and do:

    require 'autocorrect/whiny'

If you are utterly, mind-bogglingly insane, you could always do:

    require 'autocorrect/insane'

and I'll attempt to correct your method name typos for you.

## Disclaimer

This is not a serious gem. I had a crazy idea while I was reading Eloquent Ruby
and thought I'd try it out. ;-)
